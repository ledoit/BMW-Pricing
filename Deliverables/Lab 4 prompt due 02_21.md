You have a deliverable, “Ordinary Least Squares”, due February 21, 12:00 pm
noon, 2023. From your chosen project data set (either bike rentals or used
BMWs) from Lab 2, please submit:

1. Choose the response variable (Y) and one covariate (X). Please put
some thought for your response and covariate variable selection. Explain your
choice.

2. Plot Y vs X (i.e. a scatterplot) from the data.

3. Perform OLS using R on your response and covariate.

4. Please submit the output from R of OLS (coefficient estimate, t values, p
values) and interpret the results.

5. Plot also Y vs X for your choice of data set and overlay on your plot the
linear regression fit obtained from R. Is this a good model? Explain your rationale.
